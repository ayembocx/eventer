Everything should work as stated in requiremnts.

One thing to note is that user can click attend button for events they didnt host as many times as they want
but there is a check to see if they already registered to attend that event and if that is true a flash message pops
up saying they already registered to attend event and then that user is not added to attendees table redundantly.
